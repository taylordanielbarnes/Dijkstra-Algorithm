# Dijkstra-Algorithm
Assignment for Computer Science 2: implement the Dijkstra Algorithm to solve the shortest-paths problem.

RunDijkstraBinHeap.cpp: c++ code to run the dijkstra algorithm (with a minheap-based priority queue)

RunDijkstraNoHeap.cpp: c++ code to run the dijkstra algorithm (without an efficient priority queue)

Either of the above: change the VERTICES definition to the number of vertices in your graph

Graph.cpp: configure your graph in this program

All other files do not need to be changed
